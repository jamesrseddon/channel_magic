%SOLUTIONCHECKER Check solution from CVX is valid
%   Takes a vector of quasiprobabilities, calculates the corresponding
%   Pauli vector according to the supplied A_matrix, and checks that it
%   matches the target state.
%
%   The mode parameter allows a choice between checking against a target
%   state, or the Choi state for some operation.
%   MODE            DESCRIPTION
%   'state'         TARGET is a density matrix.
%   'choi'          TARGET is an operation. The Choi state will be 
%                   calculated and the solution checked against that.
%   'choi_diag'     TARGET is an operation E. The state E(|+><+|^n) will be
%                   calculated and compared with the solution.
%
%   varargin can be a tolerance for checking the solution. Otherwise
%   default tolerance will be used.
