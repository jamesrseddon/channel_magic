%%% Takes a distribution which is the solution to the LP problem
%%% to decompose a non-stabiliser state, and separates it into
%%% positive and negative parts, i.e. in (1 + p) E_+ - p E_-, 
%%% it finds E_+ and E_-. It then calculates the corresponding
%%% Pauli vectors by multiplication with the A_matrix.
