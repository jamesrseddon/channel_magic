function [output] = stateFromAffine(affine_space)
%%% Take as input an affine space specified as a binary matrix, where each
%%% row represents an element of the affine space, and output a ket vector
%%% representing the 'canonical' stabiliser state associated with that 
%%% affine space.
%%% By 'canonical' state, we mean equal superposition of all computational
%%% basis states specified by the affine space, with +1 phase on each term.
%%% Example: given the input affine space:
%%%             0 0 1 0
%%%             0 0 1 1
%%%             1 0 1 0
%%%             1 0 1 1
%%%
%%% the function will output a vector corresponding to the state:
%%%
%%% |Phi> = (|0010> + |0011> + |1010> + |1011>)/2
