function [ kraus_ops ] = conditionalChannel(measure_channel,varargin)
%CONDITIONALCHANNEL Constructs a conditional channel from building blocks.
%   Takes as input a 'measurement' channel in Kraus form. Each Kraus
%   operator is taken to represent an outcome of the measurement.
%   varargin should contain one argument for each outcome of the
%   measurement channel. These arguments should each be either a unitary or
%   a set of Kraus operators, and represents the operation that should be
%   carried out given the respective outcome.
%   EXAMPLE:
%   Let 
%   Z_measure(:,:,1) = [1 0; 0 0];
%   Z_measure(:,:,2) = [0 0; 0 1];
%
%   Z_measure is the set of Kraus operators corresponding to a measurement
%   in the single-qubit Z-basis.
%   Let U be some unitary and T be some CPTP channel, represented as a set
%   of Kraus operators.
%   
%   Then conditionalChannel(Z_measure,U,T) will output the Kraus operators
%   for the channel corresponding to the following sequence of operations:
%       1. Measure in Z-basis
%       2a. If outcome is +1, apply unitary U.
%       2b. If outcome is -1, apply CPTP map T.
