function [ out_gate_set ] = gatesetTensorIdentity( gate_set,num_id_qubits )
%GATESETTENSORIDENTITY Takes a gate set and tensors with the identity on n
% qubits.
%   Takes as input a gate set cell array of the form:
%   gate_set = {COLUMN_OF_LABELS,COLUMN_OF_MATRICES}
%   example = {'Id', [1 0; 0 1];
%              'Z',  [1 0; 0 -1];
%              ...}
%   Returns the same gate set, but with every gate U replaced with:
%       kron(U,Id), where Id is the identity for n qubits.
