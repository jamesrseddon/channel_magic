function [ L_of_rho ] = unitaryGenerator( input_state,hamiltonian )
%UNITARYGENERATOR Given a Hamiltonian, apply the corresponding generator of
% unitary evolution to an input_state
%   Quantum states evolve according to the Liouville-Von Neumann equation:
%    d(RHO)/dt = -i [ H, RHO] = L(RHO), where H is the system Hamiltonian,
%   and L is the superoperator defined by:
%   L(A) = -i [ H, A] 
%   For time-independent L, the evolution equation has formal solution:
%   RHO(t) = exp(L t) [RHO(0)]
%   We call L the generator of the evolution. (This can be generalised for
%   non-unitary processes.)
%   This function takes as input H and RHO and calculates L(RHO).

% Check inputs Hermitian up to some tolerance.
