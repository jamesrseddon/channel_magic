function [ A_matrix ] = makeAmatrixPLchoi(map_array,num_qubits)
%MAKEAMATRIXPLCHOI Construct A matrix from an array of PL representations of
% maps.
%   Input should be a column cell array where each cell contains the
%   Pauli-Liouville representation for a linear map.
%   Example:
%   {[1 0 0 0;
%     0 1 0 0;
%     0 0 1 0;
%     0 0 0 1];
%    [0 0 i 0;
%     0 0 0 1;
%    -1 0 0 0;
%    0 1 0 0]};
%
%    The function calculates the Pauli vector for the Choi matrix
%    corresponding to each map. In the output matrix, each column
%    corresponds to the choi matrix for a particular map.
%
%    num_qubits is input as a safety measure to ensure matrices are of the
%    correct dimension.
